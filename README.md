This project enables wireless control of home appliances using an HC-05 Bluetooth module, an Arduino, an LED, and a DC motor. The system allows users to turn ON/OFF appliances via a Bluetooth-enabled smartphone. How It Works: Pair HC-05 with a smartphone via Bluetooth. Use a Bluetooth terminal app to send commands: '1' → Turns ON LED '0' → Turns OFF LED '2' → Turns ON DC Motor '3' → Turns OFF DC Motor The Arduino reads the command and controls the devices accordingly.
